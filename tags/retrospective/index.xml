Some things happened that I haven&amp;rsquo;t planned for, more great than bad, which I&amp;rsquo;m very happy about!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>At this point in time, you prolly know that this blog is being kept as my personal journal,
and I&amp;rsquo;m very happy about it!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;h3 id="more-conferences">More Conferences&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve visited London again, thanks to GopherCon UK; I&amp;rsquo;ve visited Hamburg again, thanks to ContainerDays
and I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Barcelona for the first time, thanks to DevBcn! All of them were super fun to do,
had a ton of really good conversations but also, they&amp;rsquo;ve helped me to adjust what and how I want to do in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For 2024 season, I&amp;rsquo;m definitely taking a step back from conferences and travelling to various places for work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-music">More Music&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>OgrÃ³d is back, been writing a ton of new stuff to be released in the nearest future!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, there&amp;rsquo;s one project that will be, probably, premiered in 2024, where I can finally sit back a bit and be
more a musician and a producer, rather than a main songwriter&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-cooking">More Cooking&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Oh man, have I not cooked. I did a lot of stuff, planning to do even more in &amp;lsquo;24!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-youtube-and-videography">More Youtube (and videography)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t do as much as I&amp;rsquo;ve planned to, but for a good reason - read below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-quiet-moments">More Quiet Moments&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2023 was way slower and quieter on many fronts and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about it. If you&amp;rsquo;d ask a 20-year-old me if I will want to slow down,
the answer would be a resounding &lt;strong>no&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been very specific with what I invest my time in, both relationships and work things and this tactic has been playing out beautifully.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-teaching">More Teaching&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is the only thing that has turned out to be a bit different - I&amp;rsquo;ve been teaching a lot and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of good things that
have happened through it.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Also, I think I can say, that this is the first year where all of my goals have been met 100%.
Is this due to my planning or actually planning less?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="2024-goals">2024 Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Oh man, this will be a tough one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t have any specific goals for 2024. Or, another way, there are some goals which are tied to another things
that are truly outside of my power and needs another things to happen first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, this post doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any sense if I&amp;rsquo;ll do &lt;code>no goals run&lt;/code>, so here are some:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="less-social-media-activity">Less Social Media activity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found out, the older I get, the less importance social media have in my life. I don&amp;rsquo;t need to share all the things I do,
I don&amp;rsquo;t need to wave each success left and right. There&amp;rsquo;s a chance I&amp;rsquo;ll nuke some of my accounts, but I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure about it yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-side-projects-with-friends-mates-people-i-care-about">More side-projects with friends, mates, people I care about&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a few things I want to develop in 2024; one of them being one (or two) side projects with some good friends of mine.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see where this will lead me!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="profiles-irs-patches---guitar-stuff">Profiles, IRs, Patches - Guitar Stuff&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have been setting up another venture of mine where you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to either buy profiles of my gear or be able to
reamp your music through my stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m still in the early days of this one, but everything is actually moving the right way!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fluent-commucational-in-1-language">Fluent (commucational) in +1 language&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I have a personal reason to be fluent/conversational in French and I&amp;rsquo;m about to immerse myself in that language.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried (and semi-failed) at least four times already; this time, the reason why is way stronger and way better than any time before,
so no doubts, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to order food in French by the end of 2024 haha!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thank-you-notes">Thank You Notes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Throughout 2023, I had a pleasure of working with extremely talented people, on many things, for all I&amp;rsquo;m eternally grateful!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see what 2024 will bring but, again, for the first time, I don&amp;rsquo;t have many things I&amp;rsquo;m hoping for or running towards something.
I think after years of grinding, self-growth and whatnot, I can slow down a bit and regroup, plan and go even further in life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s to all of you reading this post, I hope 2024 will be good for you!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>2022 In Retrospective</title><link>https://akondas.com/blog/2022-in-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akondas.com/blog/2022-in-retrospective/</guid><description>Haven&amp;rsquo;t been extremely active here in the last year, but I still need to make my 2022 retro and 2023 prep.</description><content>&lt;p>Haven&amp;rsquo;t been extremely active here in the last year, but I still need to make my 2022 retro and 2023 prep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s a-go!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Again, this post is rather personal one. But also, this page is a very personal one.
Basically, YMMV.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This post contains a lot of media, go check it all out!&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="2022-goals">2022 Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="music">Music&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I am actually pretty happy about how this year played out, music-wise. Released one of my most favourite songs ever, wrote a lot of small snippets, all in all, musically, that was a good year.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>(no joke, for the one above, I&amp;rsquo;ve sampled my shoes for the extra authenticity)&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="session--producing-work">Session &amp;amp; Producing Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To extend the above point, I&amp;rsquo;ve been producing a way more in 2022. Consulted a few bands, wrote a lot of songs altogether, some of them due to be released soon, some I don&amp;rsquo;t know when.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="youtube-channel">Youtube Channel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched that much as I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing only small videos here and there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The plan still is to have a full-blown yt channel but there were a lot of more important things than this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

&lt;h3 id="certifications">Certifications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Haven&amp;rsquo;t had time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="another-hackathon">Another Hackathon&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to even research any.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-conference">A Conference&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>And here, I&amp;rsquo;ve done everything I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to - and more. Been to London, Hamburg and Florence this year talking about Go!&lt;/p>

>&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="new-ventures">New Ventures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Still in progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="writing-more">Writing More&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed - haven&amp;rsquo;t had time!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2023-goals">2023 Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>And now, the goals for the 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-conferences">More Conferences&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>My appetite grew tremendously last year and I&amp;rsquo;ve found the long lost joy I was missing.
If you ever performed in front of people, there&amp;rsquo;s that unmistakeable thrill that joins you when you start.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played one, literally one gig with my best friends in 2022, had a ton of fun, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t compare it to the fun I had presenting on conferences last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore, the plans are wide and the plans are big. Let&amp;rsquo;s see where I&amp;rsquo;ll end up.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-music">More Music&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>OgrÃ³d (so my songwriting/producing outlet) is long overdue for a revival, on new terms, and that&amp;rsquo;s due this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a few other projects I&amp;rsquo;m working on (both producing and writing for), some bigger, some smaller, equally stoked about all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-cooking">More Cooking&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In 2022 I haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough time for baking and cooking - both of these have become a great fun during the lockdown time and I&amp;rsquo;d love to get back to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-youtube-and-videography">More Youtube (and videography)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>2022 was actually rather good from the videography POV.
Learned a lot, would love to do more, there are a few things on the horizon, let&amp;rsquo;s see!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-quiet-moments">More Quiet Moments&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I need to be way more mindful in the 2023 about how I feel about my days.
Sometimes I need to step back from the non-stop run and think how can I just slow down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="more-teaching">More Teaching&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>And the last, but not least, the thing I&amp;rsquo;ve thought I&amp;rsquo;ll never miss again.
Thanks to conferences, I ended up missing teaching A TON.
There&amp;rsquo;s something I can&amp;rsquo;t really describe that gives me a thrill when I need to explain something - not only because it&amp;rsquo;s fun, but also because I can validate what I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where I will teach and what, that&amp;rsquo;s another story, but maybe it&amp;rsquo;s time to teach more Go and music theory? Go Music Theory? (is this name taken on Github?)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-this-blog">What about this blog?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t say &amp;ldquo;yeah, there will be a weekly post&amp;rdquo; (as much as I&amp;rsquo;d love to).
I&amp;rsquo;ll aim to write more than 1 post like last year, but there&amp;rsquo;s A LOT of stuff going on in the background - that&amp;rsquo;s why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t here so much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, there have been a lot of topics I want to write about that either I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered or should be a good starting point for a bigger discussion, so that&amp;rsquo;s happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But also, really, thank you for all who reached out in 2022, to all whom I&amp;rsquo;ve met during the conferences and to all I&amp;rsquo;ve shared a meal with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onwards and upwards into the unknown!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>2021 In Retrospective</title><link>https://akondas.com/blog/2021-in-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://akondas.com/blog/2021-in-retrospective/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve used to do these retros every year but in a different place - now, that I have my own corner of the internet for myself, I think I can do it here.</description><content>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used to do these retros every year but in a different place - now, that I have my own corner of the internet for myself, I think I can do it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we go - 2021 in retrospective!&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This post is rather personal one. But also, this page is a very personal one.
Basically, YMMV.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="2021-goals">2021 Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="start-a-youtube-channel">Start a Youtube Channel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;ve started one. Or restarted. And that&amp;rsquo;d be about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not upset about it at all as I&amp;rsquo;ve recorded a few hours of material, working on shots, frames, colours and everything in between.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is SO going to happen!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="get-certified">Get Certified&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one I feel like I&amp;rsquo;ve fulfilled in 120%:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>AWS Database Specialty&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Site Reliability Engineering Foundation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And a few smaller ones. Really happy about this in general.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="code-outside-of-work">Code Outside Of Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, this one is a homerun. Apart from a few small projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to win Chef&amp;rsquo;s Automate For Good hackathon with my Good Buddy Jason. Also, managed to build and hack my Good Buddy Dominika&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://fabric-class.teachable.com/">new training site&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="music">Music&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This one, literally as always, is somewhat split in two.
From one angle, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to write a ton of songs, record a full album (which is in post-production) and started writing more music for other people.
From another, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to release almost none. Talk about perfectionism, huh?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2022-goals">2022 Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="music-1">Music&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This is an extension of the last point - if I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to release at least two projects (out of&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember how many), I&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="session--producing-work">Session &amp;amp; Producing Work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since like mid-2020, I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing for and producing a few projects here and there. Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;d love for this to be a 30-40% of my annual workload and that&amp;rsquo;s the general aim.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2nd facade of this goal is to get back into session guitar work. I&amp;rsquo;ve used to do this way more in the past and I&amp;rsquo;m eager to get my chops back up to speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="youtube-channel">Youtube Channel&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>And that&amp;rsquo;s the 3rd (woah!) facade of the previous goal - I don&amp;rsquo;t want to compete with Pete Thorn or Rhett Shull but I see a small niche for the ideas I have and the videos I can shoot and stuff I can talk about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one thing I&amp;rsquo;m really happy about is that I&amp;rsquo;m not aiming to do Youtube or Session work full time - I&amp;rsquo;ve used to do latter full time a few years back and I really don&amp;rsquo;t want to put all eggs in one basket again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="certifications">Certifications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I want to definitely pursuit the Kubernetes stuff a bit more, there&amp;rsquo;s one or two Amazon certs I want to do (them architecture ones looks so nice) and maybe some Hashicorp one would add up to the pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But that k8s pain I want to embrace.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="another-hackathon">Another Hackathon&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t know which one, don&amp;rsquo;t know about what, I just want to build some stuff in a relatively short time again. There&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;d really hope that&amp;rsquo;d happen in 2022 but it&amp;rsquo;s not my call if it will or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-conference">A Conference&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I like nerding out and talking about stuff I find interesting.
I did a few online conferences in 2020, haven&amp;rsquo;t done any in 2021 (life, huh?) but I really want to do one or two in 2022.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that leads us to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="new-ventures">New Ventures&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;which you&amp;rsquo;ll know about more in a due time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="writing-more">Writing More&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Last but not least, I&amp;rsquo;d love to write more here.
I like that I can rant here, I like that I can brag here and I like that I have a full control over what I write and how does it look.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted it to be a tech blog 100%, I always wanted to have a very open-ended thing here.
Hope to have time to write more!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-so-many-goals">Why So Many Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I like to have more on my plate than less - this way I can drop the things that are not exactly profitable or worth pursuing in the given timeframe.
Out of the ones up there, there&amp;rsquo;s a few that are a bit higher up and a few that are a bit lower on the list.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thank-you">Thank you&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although there has been less than a dozen posts here, I&amp;rsquo;m really grateful that you&amp;rsquo;re readimg my ramblings here - and a few of you actually reached out and talked with me about them. I&amp;rsquo;m raising a glass for you today!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, we&amp;rsquo;ve been through a very weird 2021, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think 2022 will be any less than this - hope it&amp;rsquo;ll be tho but, there&amp;rsquo;s a saying &lt;em>hope for the best, prepare for the worst&lt;/em> - and that&amp;rsquo;s my mantra during these odd times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope that 2022 will treat you how you want it to do and hope we&amp;rsquo;ll cross paths on a Slack call somewhere or start a very ignited convo under some random post in a deep ends of our professional bubble.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy New Year!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
