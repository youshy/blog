Let&rsquo;s Go!*</p><blockquote><p>I definitely need to work on my Go puns&mldr;</p></blockquote><h2 id=how-i-did-it>How I Did It<a href=#how-i-did-it class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>My story with Go, as I&rsquo;ve told it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7tyWi24mMY">here</a> was simple - my good buddy Alex (hope you&rsquo;re reading this mate!), with whom I was working in a start up in London told me:</p><blockquote><p>DUDE, THERE&rsquo;S AN AMAZING LANGUAGE YOU NEED TO LEARN. IT&rsquo;S CALLED GO AND YOU WILL LOVE IT!</p></blockquote><p>Given that Alex knows his stuff EXTREMELY well, I was more than keen on jumping on this train. My approach was simple:</p><ul><li><a href=#research>Research</a></li><li><a href=#apply>Apply</a></li><li><a href=#improve>Improve</a></li><li><a href=#push>Push</a></li><li><a href=#repeat>Repeat</a></li></ul><h3 id=research>Research<a href=#research class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>I needed to know what Go is about. I didn&rsquo;t spent much time reading about the syntax, or learning who build it and why, I just wanted to start writing in it.</p><p>So, I&rsquo;ve started like everyone with <a href=https://tour.golang.org>A Tour of Go</a>. Did all the lessons, wrote down the very first syntax rules and keywords. But I needed more.</p><h3 id=apply>Apply<a href=#apply class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>First thing I&rsquo;ve written with Go was a simple, <code>CSV</code> based <a href=https://github.com/youshy/go-guitar-api>API</a> for keeping a track of my guitars.</p><p>The code there is ugly, not well written - but it works. As a proof-of-concept, that&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p><h3 id=improve>Improve<a href=#improve class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Yet after a few days, that wasn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;ve wanted. Back when I&rsquo;ve started working with Go, I was a Full Stack Software Engineer, working mostly with Node and Vue. You know the feeling when you kinda know how something works and you&rsquo;re just anxious to work it out in the new field?</p><p>That&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;ve felt! So, my next thing was more production-ready <a href=https://github.com/youshy/go-json-api>API</a> that, finally, works with <code>JSON</code> files. Looking at it now I don&rsquo;t like a lot of stuff there: the router is not how I&rsquo;d write it now, handlers are messy and it still doesn&rsquo;t have any database connection ready.</p><h3 id=push>Push<a href=#push class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Jump almost a year from this moment, I&rsquo;m a full time Go developer, writing a ton of RESTful APIs and my latest approach to how I do it is <a href=https://github.com/youshy/Hands-On-Ready-To-Deploy-Golang-CRUD-API>here</a> - also, if you want to follow me on that journey, join me in the next <a href=https://www.meetup.com/DevOpsPlayground/events/270672982/>DevOps Playground</a> from the comfy corner of your couch!</p><p>There&rsquo;s still a lot of things missing from this tutorial about how I do stuff - which I&rsquo;ll probably talk about later on.</p><h3 id=repeat>Repeat<a href=#repeat class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>In those four steps, I took a very beginning of my journey from almost a zero to somewhat being happy with what I write.</p><p>But that&rsquo;s just a tip of the iceberg - since I&rsquo;ve started learning Go I&rsquo;ve written:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/gitutil>A utility tool for switching between multiple github accounts and creating repos remotely</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/wiki>A CLI for checking Wikipedia without leaving my terminal</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/go-psql-triggers>A small study on using PostgreSQL triggers with Go</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/pac-go-man>A pacman in terminal</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/goapify>A wrapper for python files which automatically creates an API</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/nju>A helper package for writing these posts</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/youshy/bready-steady-go>A checker for my two favourite mills if they have opened their online shop</a></li></ul><p>And many more. I&rsquo;ve been playing with <a href=https://github.com/youshy/biip-beep-boop>processing audio with Go</a> and <a href=https://github.com/youshy/mongo-over-grpc>gRPC based APIs</a> recently - and that&rsquo;s just in my free time.</p><p>Work-wise I have another set of things I&rsquo;m working on.</p><hr><h2 id=how-i-would-do-it-again>How I Would Do It Again<a href=#how-i-would-do-it-again class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Following the same five steps, let&rsquo;s think about how I would start learning&mldr; C++. It&rsquo;s been a long-time personal goal for me to be fluent in C++ but since Go has rocked my world, I haven&rsquo;t had that much time to work on it.</p><p>How I&rsquo;d approach that - for the sake of this part, let&rsquo;s assume I&rsquo;ll write a VST (Virtual Studio Technology) plugin for recording.</p><h3 id=research-1>Research<a href=#research-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>The simplest way would be to build a two-knob, very simple UI plugin with a distortion circuit - something that takes the initial signal, cranks up the gain and returns the overdriven sound. For now, I wouldn&rsquo;t worry about the sound being somewhat digital (as it would be).</p><h3 id=apply-1>Apply<a href=#apply-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>As we know the UI is not that great, I&rsquo;d probably spend some time in honing my skills in that domain. Given that I&rsquo;m not the best designer ever - I can hear things well, I don&rsquo;t see the design well - that would take some time.</p><h3 id=improve-1>Improve<a href=#improve-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Once I&rsquo;d get the UI bit a tad better, then the next logical step would be to manipulate the equalization in my new plugin. So that&rsquo;d require extra step in programming this part.</p><h3 id=push-1>Push<a href=#push-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Once done, I&rsquo;d move to another VST - maybe this time a tape simulator? Full blown delay circuit? Reverb? Impulse Response -based reverb?</p><h3 id=repeat-1>Repeat<a href=#repeat-1 class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h3><p>Of course, while doing that, I&rsquo;d probably build an in-terminal Tank game or an RESTful API (as far as I know, that&rsquo;s not the easiest task in C++) or literally anything else.</p><hr><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions<a href=#conclusions class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>The key to this approach is to repeat, repeat, repeat. Don&rsquo;t get sad about something not working the way you want it to work and don&rsquo;t overthink it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">Just do it!</a></p><p>Considering how much time has passed since I&rsquo;ve written a lot of these small apps:</p><ul><li>Am I happy about the quality? Not that much.</li><li>Am I proud of them? Heck yes!</li></ul><p>Even if they are not the best, they show where I&rsquo;ve been some time ago. These are a clear indicators of the progress I&rsquo;ve made to be where I am now.
Although sometimes I end up wandering in &ldquo;what-could-have-been&rdquo; part of my memories, I wouldn&rsquo;t change a thing I&rsquo;ve did in my life - all of these things brought me here - and I&rsquo;m more than happy about it!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve used the same approach in music, baking, languages - heck, even in circuits building. It applies to anything new you want to learn - and it works.</p><p>Give it a try and then @ me on <a href=https://twitter.com/arturkondas>Twitter</a> and let&rsquo;s chat!</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><span class="button previous"><a href=/blog/why-devops-engineers-should-know-go/><span class=button__icon>←</span>
