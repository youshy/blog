Part I Part II As you&rsquo;ve probably figured out from the title, I&rsquo;ve renamed my small series Tales of Docker and Go to Tales of Devops and Go. Why is that? As I&rsquo;m branching out to setting up more stuff from ground up, I think that going with more DevOps route will be better than narrowing ourselves down to Docker only.
That said, let&rsquo;s go!

How to use Docker and Go Modules with private repos? Since our last talk about using private repositories with Go Modules, I&rsquo;ve been playing with setting up Docker images for modules-based apps. As you might remember, I wasn&rsquo;t a fan of Go Mod but that has changed slightly!
