How can I write software?&rdquo;. Although, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m any authority in this topic, I&rsquo;ve helped a few people land their first software development jobs. Today we&rsquo;ll talk about the thing, that recruiters seems to rave about and most of us are even scared to think about - <strong>how to contribute to OSS for the first time?</strong></p><h2 id=translate-it>Translate it!<a href=#translate-it class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Easiest way is to literally take a piece of software and translate it to your native language. I can hear you - &ldquo;WHAT IF I SPEAK ONLY ENGLISH?!&rdquo; - then help any non-native speakers improve their English translations. For you it&rsquo;ll be ultra easy; for them it&rsquo;ll help their grammar, vocabulary and ways of thinking in English.</p><p>For the last two years, I have contributed to a VS Code translation from English to Polish (how to do that in a sec), contributed a bit to <a href=https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea>Gitea</a> translation (Gitea is amazing btw!) and translated two small libs on GitHub - <a href=https://github.com/aahung/Unshaky>Unshaky</a> which tackles very annoying problems with >2016 MacBooks Pro keyboards and <a href=https://github.com/rxhanson/Rectangle>Rectangle</a> which adds Windows 10 functionality to your MacOS and allows you to divide the screen into multiple chunks!</p><p>About VS Code (and probably Gitea) translation - both of these use 3rd party software/pages to contribute with translations - makes the work painless and easy!</p><h2 id=tackle-the-giants>Tackle the giants<a href=#tackle-the-giants class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>I&rsquo;ve been raving about my <a href=https://github.com/grafana/grafana>Grafana</a> contribution for a while now - apart from working on small libs here and there, this was my first <strong>big</strong> contribution to OSS. Sounds big, but it was as easy as going through the <strong>Issues</strong> tab, finding the one I could tackle and just working on it! My first PR was a mess tho, but nobody has to know, shh&mldr;</p><h2 id=but-how-can-i-find-it>But how can I find it?<a href=#but-how-can-i-find-it class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Chances are, that if you&rsquo;re using some custom software, doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a Video player or your favourite iOS/Android app, it will have some translation to do. If the code is on GitHub, you can check if they&rsquo;re allowing contributors to translate their app.</p><p>Second way (that&rsquo;s the one I&rsquo;ve used to find Unshaky and Rectangle) is reading <a href=https://news.ycombinator.com/>HackerNews</a>. Apart from it being one of the best ways to learn about great new tech and getting a different view on various topics, once in a while there will be <strong>Show HN</strong> topic, where someone shows (sic!) their software. 99% they will need help with something - just do it!</p><h2 id=but-what-if-ill-fail>But what if I&rsquo;ll fail?<a href=#but-what-if-ill-fail class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>We all do. That&rsquo;s the part of the process. Instead of being afraid of it - embrace it.</p><p>That&rsquo;s the way to grow. You don&rsquo;t have to do a sequel to VS Code immediately. Baby Steps. <strong>BABY STEPS</strong>.</p><hr><p>So the aspiration from this post is to write at least one blog post weekly; hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to work it out! If you have anything you&rsquo;d like to read about, ping me on LinkedIn, <em>@arturkondas</em> on Twitter or Instagram&mldr; Just reach out!</p><p>Also, as you (hopefully!) can see, we&rsquo;re in dark mode now!
