It was surprisingly tricky to build, due to data structure of WikiAPI.</p><p>Another one - this post is written using my <a href=github.com/youshy/nju>small package</a> that preps the file for me, opens up <code>vim</code> and allows me to stream from my head super easily and fast. And then it commits this post. And I still haven&rsquo;t left my command line!</p><p>You can extend this approach to anything that you do. Literally - if you like pizza, learn how to make one. A few of those will be surprisingly bad, but one of these will rock your world. And then you have another party skill!</p><hr><p>Do stuff for fun.
