      <description>So, I did the Rust setup recently, so I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out I&amp;rsquo;ll do the one for Go as well (as I work with Go daily).
Getting Vim to work with Go  Get Vim Install Go Install coc and vim-go with your favourite plugin manager Run in Vim: CocInstall coc-go - more info here Add to your .vimrc:  &amp;#34; &amp;#34; Go setup &amp;#34; let g:go_fmt_command = &amp;#34;goimports&amp;#34; let g:go_gocode_propose_source = 0 let g:go_auto_type_info = 1 let g:go_version_warning = 0 Do you run your setup differently?</description>

      <description>Before I&amp;rsquo;ll jump into the topic, as you can see this is my first post since a while. A lot of stuff has happened, most of them good - hope that your personal Apocalypse Now has been, at least a bit, good for you!
 Every now and then, there&amp;rsquo;s a new big &amp;ldquo;gamechanger&amp;rdquo; in the tech world. A few years ago it was Agile ways of working, not so far ago it was CI/CD, small, yet stable changes (so basically Agile v2) - now it&amp;rsquo;s diversity, inclusion and equity.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: My band ENAEhas released a first single, called The System. Song is 100% DIY (from writing to recording to mixing to producing to releasing) and the music video is written 100% in Go!

      <description>Have you ever asked yourself any of the questions below:
HOW SHOULD I START MY NEW GO PROJECT? WILL THIS IMPACT MY LIFE? SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TODAY? SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TOMORROW? Let&amp;rsquo;s go with the answers we know first:
 SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TODAY? - Yes SHOULD I GO GET PIZZA TOMORROW? - Yes   Why are you even wondering about that&amp;hellip; Pizza never wonders about you, it just wraps you in the cheesy love and (okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll stop there)</description>

      <description>Today is a very good day - after a loooo(&amp;hellip;)oong time of not releasing any new music, I&amp;rsquo;ve released an album!
10 songs, all sung in Polish, all in indie-rap genre, first one I have ever produced with my good frieds - everything from music to vocals! We have amazing guests on the album, from legends of Polish alternative to long-time rap kings; mixed by Webber (which is, by the way, one of my childhood dreams to have my music mixed by this guy) and mastered by Eprom.</description>

 Part I Part II  As you&amp;rsquo;ve probably figured out from the title, I&amp;rsquo;ve renamed my small series Tales of Docker and Go to Tales of Devops and Go. Why is that? As I&amp;rsquo;m branching out to setting up more stuff from ground up, I think that going with more DevOps route will be better than narrowing ourselves down to Docker only.
That said, let&amp;rsquo;s go!
How to set up your Go repos with CircleCI and Sonarcloud Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with a SonarCloud - recommended by one of my friends, the service improves your quality of code by constantly checking the bugs, code duplicates, anything you might ever oversee while coding!</description>

How to use Docker and Go Modules with private repos? Since our last talk about using private repositories with Go Modules, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing with setting up Docker images for modules-based apps. As you might remember, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a fan of Go Mod but that has changed slightly!
The approach below will be based on Bitbucket, but it should work out-of-the-box for any version control system.</description>

If you know that you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to attend, fear not! I&amp;rsquo;ve prepared the whole workshop in a form of a GitHub repo you can follow and recreate everything that we&amp;rsquo;ll code!</description>

Server Logic I won&amp;rsquo;t lie to you, the code you will see here won&amp;rsquo;t be entirely beautiful. That&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of this tutorial - our Playground has covered how to build a Production-Grade API you can easily use in your daily work; whereas this one is more of a PoC you can use to show that Go is really nice.
The code architecture will stay mostly the same.</description>

      <description>First of all - thanks to all who has attended the playground! We&amp;rsquo;re trying to find a format that will benefit us all in these new times, and it makes the work 100x better knowing, that what we&amp;rsquo;ve prepared works for you! If you want to watch the playground again, check it on YouTube!
The playground assumed, more or less, that you have a full control over your development environment and you can choose with what you want to work.</description>

Most of the DevOps tools are written in Go The very first, never released to the public, version of Docker was written in Python – but, the initial release was made using one of the initial (!</description>

      <description>How to exit Vim in three simple steps.
Using Go, of course.
 Make sure you have Go installed. Write a whole application to find and kill vim:  package main import ( &amp;#34;bytes&amp;#34; &amp;#34;io/ioutil&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;path/filepath&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strconv&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; ) func TerminateVim(path string, info os.FileInfo, err error) error { var proc []int if strings.Count(path, &amp;#34;/&amp;#34;) == 3 { if strings.Contains(path, &amp;#34;/status&amp;#34;) { pid, err := strconv.Atoi(path[6:strings.LastIndex(path, &amp;#34;/&amp;#34;)]) if err !</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s DevOps Playground? It&amp;rsquo;s a meetup for devops-oriented techies who wants to learn something new about their profession. This time, I&amp;rsquo;m more than proud to run the next one on May 28th and teach you all something about writing full CRUD (Create-Read-Upload-Delete) RESTful API in Go!</description>

But how do I write them in the first place?

How To Start Contributing To Open-Source I had a countless conversations in the last 3 years about &amp;ldquo;How to start? How can I write software?&amp;rdquo;. Although, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m any authority in this topic, I&amp;rsquo;ve helped a few people land their first software development jobs. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the thing, that recruiters seems to rave about and most of us are even scared to think about - how to contribute to OSS for the first time?</description>

The truth is, that our current world is our Infinity War - we&amp;rsquo;re not in the Endgame yet and (hopefully) we won&amp;rsquo;t have just 1 option out of over 14 million that will be the correct one.
The world has changed a lot in 2020 - but we all know that. The reason why I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post, is that a lot of my friends are struggling in el nuevo mundo del cuarentena, whereas I seem to thrive and make the best of it.</description>

So I&amp;rsquo;ve started baking bread Actually, it started with pizza - most of the folks at my job already knows about my obsession about a proper slice, but my second, yeast-and-flour-infused love is bread - which is not really surprising, as I&amp;rsquo;m Polish.</description>

      <description>Yes, yes, I know, this is not a proper blog if I don&amp;rsquo;t post often. But hey, that&amp;rsquo;s the name of the game, when you&amp;rsquo;re working on fun stuff!
Talking about fun stuff - have you ever tried to dockerize your Go app? Probably it&amp;rsquo;s easy, there&amp;rsquo;s a ton of Medium posts on how to do that. But what to do when one of your packages is behind the private organisation?</description>

      <description>Personally, I believe in surrounding myself with people who do something good and/or are experts in what they do and/or are just good human beings. This way, the bar I set for myself with what I do and how I do it, is gradually coming up. And that&amp;rsquo;s what happened last Friday.
For the second time in a row, I was asked to do a workshop at ColorInTech&amp;rsquo;s event - ColorCode.</description>

      <description>Well, we all have to start somewhere. If you read any, literally any blog post or Medium article about &amp;ldquo;How to be a super coder and earn TONS OF MONEY FAST&amp;rdquo;, everyone will say
Write something that will showcase your skills. And, probably, the main thing is that they&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to build your first blog page or anything like this.
Fast forward a few months You end up in a place I&amp;rsquo;ve been in (and almost anyone I know was) - what to do next?</description>
