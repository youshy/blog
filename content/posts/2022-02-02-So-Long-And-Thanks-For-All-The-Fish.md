After almost two years and eight months at ECS, the time has come for me to kickstart a new chapter in my career. Given the time I've spent here, it'd feel really bad not to say thanks to all the amazing people I've worked with.

First and foremost, thanks to my managers, Marian Knotek and Rob Thatcher for their input, guidance and friendship across the years. 
Thanks to my teammates across different projects - Viorica, Babak, Charles, Akshay, Vincent, Michael, Al.
Thanks to
