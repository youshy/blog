If you're a techie, you know that this year has been absolutely red hot when it comes to jobs. But job hunting comes with an absolute crapton of entitlement* - from all sides.

It's a really weird and not-so-colourfull world we live in at the moment - the best thing one can do, is **not being a dick**. What I want to explore is - how not to be a dick when you're either switching jobs or trying to convince somebody to switch jobs.

We will look from four angles - as an employee who wants to change/is changing jobs, as an employee who wants to retain people, as a recruiter who wants to, well, recruit people and as a human being who's in the middle of it all.

## As an Employee

So, that's the seemingly easy bit - *I just hand in my notice and fuck-it-all* or, even worst, *I'll burn everything down*. 

The thing is, you can do it with a lot of dignity and with a proper communication. Of course, this assumes that you already had a good rapport with your manager, which - in my opinion - is quintessential in having a nice, lasting tenure in your current company.

What you might do:

### Start a conversation with your manager about you looking around. 

Worst case scenario (which is highly unlikely to happen) - your manager will be "mad" (?) at you that you're trying to leave.

Best case scenario - maybe you really don't want to leave but you're feeling like you've hit the ceiling in your current role or you just need a change of scenery. 
There's always a new project, a new team or a new training you can do to ensure that you're still growing in what you do.

### Be open about what you're after.

This basically goes together with the previous point - if you need something new, be open about it.
Don't be the person that is miserable but won't tell anybody about it (I know it's hard, but it's the right way to grow as a human, really).

### Don't burn your bridges.

I've seen this way too many times. There's no virtue in leaving your current place and tearing the house down.
Doesn't matter how bad your current place is, remember that your manager, their manager and the CEO are still humans. Just be mindful about that.

The other thing is - you never know where your life will lead you. If you're reading this post, there's a very high chance that (sadly!) you're not a heir to a fortune and you're still figuring things out as they go.
You might find yourself needing help from someone from your old work, or maybe you know that somebody has the skillset that you might need.

And last, but not least, be the bigger person here - if you're finishing your time with the worst company in the whole goddamn world (but they haven't done anything unlawful or really, really, REALLY bad), just say *thanks for the time I've spent with you*, pack your things and go. Whatever happened, happened and you're off to the next big adventure - focus on that!
