If you're a techie, you know that this year has been absolutely red hot when it comes to jobs. But job hunting comes with an absolute crapton of entitlement* - from all sides.

> * I don't know if entitlement is the right word here but read on to figure out what I want to say!

It's a really weird and not-so-colourfull world we live in at the moment - the best thing one can do, is **not being a dick**. What I want to explore is - how not to be a dick when you're either switching jobs or trying to convince somebody to switch jobs.

We will look from four angles - as an employee who wants to change/is changing jobs, as an employee who wants to retain people, as a recruiter who wants to, well, recruit people and as a human being who's in the middle of it all.

## As an Employee

So, that's the seemingly easy bit - *I just hand in my notice and fuck-it-all* or, even worst, *I'll burn everything down*. 

The thing is, you can do it with a lot of dignity and with a proper communication. Of course, this assumes that you already had a good rapport with your manager, which - in my opinion - is quintessential in having a nice, lasting tenure in your current company.

What you might do:

### Start a conversation with your manager about you looking around. 

Worst case scenario (which is highly unlikely to happen) - your manager will be "mad" (?) at you that you're trying to leave.

Best case scenario - maybe you really don't want to leave but you're feeling like you've hit the ceiling in your current role or you just need a change of scenery. 
There's always a new project, a new team or a new training you can do to ensure that you're still growing in what you do.

### Be open about what you're after.

This basically goes together with the previous point - if you need something new, be open about it.
Don't be the person that is miserable but won't tell anybody about it (I know it's hard, but it's the right way to grow as a human, really).

### Don't burn your bridges.

I've seen this way too many times. There's no virtue in leaving your current place and tearing the house down.
Doesn't matter how bad your current place is, remember that your manager, their manager and the CEO are still humans. Just be mindful about that.

The other thing is - you never know where your life will lead you. If you're reading this post, there's a very high chance that (sadly!) you're not a heir to a fortune and you're still figuring things out as they go.
You might find yourself needing help from someone from your old work, or maybe you know that somebody has the skillset that you might need.

And last, but not least, be the bigger person here - if you're finishing your time with the worst company in the whole goddamn world (but they haven't done anything unlawful or really, really, REALLY bad), just say *thanks for the time I've spent with you*, pack your things and go. Whatever happened, happened and you're off to the next big adventure - focus on that!

## As an Employer

Okay, this one might be fun - I've never employed anyone, so this will be mostly "how I'd like to be treated by the companies I'm working for".

> Yet another disclaimer here
>
> Please, do not associate these things here to any of my previous, current or future employers. This is based on multitude of years of observations from various viewpoints.

### Listen to your team.

That should go without saying - if all decisions are made by the C-suite with little to no regards to what your employees think, well, don't be surprised if your current team will walk on you.

You literally can't have a good product if the team behind it doesn't believe in either the product itself or your capabilities in shipping it to the market. Nobody wants to spend months of their lives on something that will be binned eventually and won't ever see the light of day.

### Give options to grow.

If you're a tech company that uses PHP and Java 6 and you're wondering why the median tenancy is 6 months - well, read this sentence again.

I don't think there's another field that is as competitive as IT and grows as fast - not saying that you should flip your current stack on it's head but maybe introduce something new? Maybe [email somebody](mailto:hello@akondas.com) and get them to introduce Go within your company? IDK...

### Grow as a company.

Simple things as, I don't know, having a nice maternity package or having inclusive socials - not everybody wants to socialise face-to-face, maybe the online social you did a year ago in the middle of C-word was a big hit - why won't you do it again?
Or just have nice, 6-months pay reviews - you're moaning about "how hard it is to retain people" but you have yearly salary reviews and you do 5% pay increase then - have you seen how high inflation went this year?

### Real life =/= LinkedIn life.

I always like how companies are promoting themselves as "the best place to work" with having really big turnover (it's not really hard to figure this out in these days).
Glassdoor reviews maybe doesn't reflect the reality 100%, as a lot of these reviews might be written after something has happened in the workplace so it's filled with bad voodoo and really bad emotions - but they do have some truth in them.

Aim for your company to reflect your marketing team game in the real life. And revert to point no.1 - listen to your employees, they will **literally** tell you what's wrong with the company and, most probably, will propose how you can fix it.
