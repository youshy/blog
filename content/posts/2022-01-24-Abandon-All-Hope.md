I had a conversation with my friend the other day about gear.
He said that he's a minimalist - when he buys gear, it's well researched and he only buys it if he really needs it. 
I'm a different kind of a beast - I buy gear because I'll need it in the future. It's well researched, but the side effect of it is that my room looks like a small, boutique music shop. 

Let me take you on a journey how I research gear, what's the condition to buy it are and why I believe my approach is somewhat sane - although on paper it doesn't feel like one.

## Maximalism?

I tend to think about myself as a bit of maximalist - at any given time, in my small home studio, I have almost all the flavours I might need for almost any genre.
Everything has started a few years ago when I've started *Ogród*:

*Ogród* (polish word for *Garden) is my producer's-wet-dream-outlet - very much inspired by Americana genre but not necessarily bound to it.
I've always wanted to have a project where I can build all the pieces however I see fit.

The very similar approach followed me to *Everybody Needs An Enemy* where I share the duties with a really good friend of mine:

But this post isn't about music, it's about the tools to make it.

## How to buy gear

I have a 4-tier rulebook I use to understand if I really need something or how should I start looking for it.

### Because you need the sound

### Because you need the feature

### Because it's a scene staple

### Because you want to

## Disclaimer

Although this post feels very much like a *"if you like it, then buy it"* kind of a deal, it's not.
I've spent literally two decades of learning about gear, about the sounds I like and moving tons of it before I've started amassing the stuff I've really liked.

So on that note - **don't buy more gear unless you REALLY know what you have, inside out**.
And I mean it - my first proper electric guitar was disassembled to every single screw multiple times, I've broken a lot of stuff in it and had to find a way to make it work - but in the end, that's the experience you can't fake.

If you don't have money - build some pedals, start learning about that stuff.
Money will come but before it does, get experience.
