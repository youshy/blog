I had a conversation with my friend the other day about gear.
He said that he's a minimalist - when he buys gear, it's well researched and he only buys it if he really needs it. 
I'm a different kind of a beast - I buy gear because I'll need it in the future. It's well researched, but the side effect of it is that my room looks like a small, boutique music shop. 

Let me take you on a journey how I research gear, what's the condition to buy it are and why I believe my approach is somewhat sane - although on paper it doesn't feel like one.
