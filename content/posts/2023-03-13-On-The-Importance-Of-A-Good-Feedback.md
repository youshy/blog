This post is trying out a completely new approach to writing which I'll be trialing for a while now,
with a goal to analyse it afterwards. 

Enjoy!

## The Mirror

Feedback is like a mirror that shows us how others see us. 
Do we look fabulous, or do we have spinach in our teeth?
It's not always easy to hear what others think of us, but feedback is an essential tool in personal and professional growth.

Sometimes, even if it's harsh, a feedback that points you to the right direction, might mark a pivotal point in your life.
After all, we don't know all and we want to grow.

## The Karaoke Machine

Have you ever wondered how you come across to others?
Maybe you think you're the life of the party, but others see you as the person who hogs the karaoke machine.
Receiving feedback can give us an objective view of our behavior and help us make adjustments to improve.

It's not always easy to take feedback, though.
It can be as painful as realizing you've been walking around with your fly open all day.
But if we approach feedback with an open mind and a willingness to learn, we can benefit from the constructive criticism.

## Feedback With No Value

However, not all feedback is created equal. 
Non-constructive feedback that focuses on personal attacks, or, even worst, providing no feedback at all or a dismissive one-liner, rather than specific behaviors, doesn't provide any value.

It's like when someone tells you that your presentation was terrible, but doesn't give you any specific reasons why.

It leaves you feeling frustrated and confused, like when you accidentally put salt instead of sugar in your morning coffee.

To be effective, feedback needs to be specific, actionable, and focused on behaviors that can be changed.
So, the next time you're giving or receiving feedback, make sure it's constructive and provides clear direction for improvement.

## Giving Feedback

Have you ever given feedback to someone and felt like you're walking on eggshells?
Providing feedback can be just as challenging as receiving it.
It's hard to strike the right balance between being honest and not hurting someone's feelings.
But when done effectively, giving feedback can be a game-changer.

By giving feedback, we give others the opportunity to improve their performance, which can benefit both individuals and organizations.
When we give feedback, we need to make sure we're specific and focus on behaviors that can be changed.
We also need to make sure we're coming from a place of kindness and a desire to help, rather than a desire to criticize.

After all, no one likes being told they're the office clown.

## Is It Really THIS Important?

In conclusion, feedback is an essential tool for growth and development.
So, don't be afraid to ask for feedback and listen to what others have to say.
By embracing feedback as a tool for growth and improvement, we can all become better versions of ourselves.

And when it comes to giving feedback, remember to be constructive, specific, and kind.
By doing so, we can create a culture of growth and improvement in our personal and professional lives, and avoid the awkward moments of realizing we've had spinach in our teeth all day.

Because, sometimes we get the spinach in our teeth. And that's ok!
