My team has won the Chef's Automate for Good hackathon recently - here's a sneak peek into why we did it, how we did it and if we'd do it again. Featuring my good buddy and teammate Jason Field!

I haven't written for a while, huh? Well, 2021 is about to end, my life won't be the same anymore (IYKYK) but in the meantime, I've managed to team up with a friend of mine, amazing devops fella, Jason Field, write a piece of code that has won the Automate for Good hackathon in "Most Promising Idea" category!

Without further adieu, let's dive into it.

## But Why?

Short answer is - because we've wanted to.

The long answer is - because I wanted a PS5 and we wanted to write some good Go code.

The submission is called Stylelia - and here's Jason to tell you more about what it is:

## How?

The biggest thing was, that we TDD'd the living crap out of our code - albeit we had 8 weeks to build it, we've decided that we'll either build it proper, or not build it at all.

Whole thing is built using Go and leveraging Cookstyle within AWS Lambda ecosystem.

## Would you do it again?

Me? Definitely yes. I like building stuff and also it helps finding your shortcomings.

## Listen to us rambling about it

If you really want, you can listen to us talking about Stylelia (and a lot more) on youtube:
