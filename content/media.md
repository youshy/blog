Apart from writing code as my daily job, I do produce, record, compose and release a lot of music and different stuff. Here you can find a few things I've been working on so far!

## Youtube

A fair bit of guitar videos - more things to come somewhere in the future when I'll have a proper place to shoot these videos!

## Everybody Needs An Enemy

Most favourite project to date - produced with a good buddy Hunor here in London, hopefully we'll finish the songs one day!

Also, featuring first (and so far only!) music video written in Go:

And the acoustic version of it (both songs featuring our previous singer, amazing Sarah Cairns!)

Tap3s is a musical partnership between me and my good mate Bartek. We do a lot of alternative sounds. Literally a lot!

That was/is my songwriter/producer outlet. Both songs are composed, arranged, recorded (apart from vocals) and mixed by me.

Everything below the line here is VERY old stuff but I'm very proud of it!

(Honestly I didn't even know it existed)

For the curious ones - Ego Trip was a band I played with in Polish edition of Must Be The Music. We even got to the finals! I'll leave this breadcrumb for you to follow...
