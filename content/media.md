Apart from writing code as my daily job, I do produce, record, compose and release a lot of music and different stuff. Here you can find a few things I've been working on so far!

All pics are clickable and will take you places!

## Youtube

A fair bit of guitar videos - more things to come somewhere in the future when I'll have a proper place to shoot these videos!

## Everybody Needs An Enemy

Most favourite project to date - produced with a good buddy Hunor here in London, hopefully we'll finish the songs one day!

Also, featuring first (and so far only!) music video written in Go:

And the acoustic version of it (both songs featuring our previous singer, amazing Sarah Cairns!)
